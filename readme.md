# AI-Powered Early Health Anomaly Detection System 💙

## Project Overview
This project is an AI-powered health monitoring system that detects early anomalies in physiological data such as heart rate, blood oxygen levels, sleep patterns, and activity levels. The system uses machine learning (Isolation Forest) to provide real-time anomaly detection, alerts, and preventive recommendations.

**SDG Focus:** SDG 3 – Good Health & Well-Being  
This system contributes to ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being through early detection of potential health risks.
